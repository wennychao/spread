        I gave a lecture at a web conference and afterward got into a fascinating conversation with a young digital design student. It was fun to compare where we were in our careers.
        </p>

        <p>
        I had fifteen years of experience designing for web clients, she had one year, and yet, we were in the same situation: we enjoyed the work, but were confused & overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing complexity of it all. What the hell happened? <em>(That’s a rhetorical question, of course.)</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Neither of us had an answer, but a bit of time and distance has shown me that we must do both. I’d like to extend that conversation today and attempt to capture my perspective on that confusion and what it costs us.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Absence was the primary source of confusion. Three years ago, I stopped making websites for clients to focus on <em>Abstract</em>, a software company I co-founded. My work there finished at the beginning of last year, and after some time off, I decided to reopen the design studio I was running beforehand.
        </p>
        
        <p id="p5">
        And wouldn’t you know it? The first few jobs through the door were websites. A lot can change in three years, so I decided to brush up on the latest developments in how to best make websites… <em>and oh my…</em>
        </p>

        <h3> Things have gotten messy haven't they?<br>
            <div id="empty-box2"></div>
            <span class="emoticon"> { ●´⌓`● } </span>
        </h3>


        <p class="top-p">
        At first I was bummed about my studio’s lack of visible progress, but then it hit me: <em>what if 
        I nailed it? Why change if it’s working?</em> I’ve been able to approach a lot of projects from many different angles; I’m happy to report that I’ve gotten pretty good at a lot of it!
        </p>

        <p>
        Except with the websites, because I don’t feel much better at making them after twenty years. My knowledge and skills develop a bit, then things change, and half of what I know becomes dead weight. This hardly happens with any of the other work I do.
        </p>
            
        <p>
        I wonder if I have twenty years of experience making websites, or if it is really five years of experience, repeated four times. If you’ve worked in the technology industry a while, please tell me this sounds familiar to you.
        </p>
            
        <p>
        As I said, I made my first website 20 years ago. I know this because I was a teenager doing the Lord’s work: transcribing the lyrics to Radiohead’s <em>OK Computer.</em> It was 1997,
        I was learning HTML, & there was one issue with the design that was confusing me: how do I put two things next to each other?
        </p>
            
        <p class="bottom-p">
        Twenty years later, we’re still working out the answer to that very basic question.
        </p>

        <div class="orange-rec"></div>

        <h4 id="table">
            &#60;table&#62;
            <div class="tab1">&#60;tr&#62;</div>
            <div class="tab2">&#60;td&#62;Hi&#60;/td&#62;</div>
            <div class="tab2">&#60;td&#62;Mom&#60;/td&#62;</div>
            <div class="tab1">&#60;/tr&#62;</div>
            &#60;/table&#62;
        </h4>

        <p class="define">
        Back in 1997, we used tables and spacer gifs. It was like designing a website in a spreadsheet from hell. I found this process fun for some reason. Perhaps I was intrigued by the potential of just bashing something together in my room, hitting a button, then having it be <em>“out there.”</em>
        </p>

        <div class="orange-rec"></div>

        <h4 class="overlap"> { float: left; } </h4>

        <p class="define">
        About five years later, websites moved to using floats in CSS because tables were not semantic. <em>Fair enough!</em> Since then, I’ve spent about 200 hours reading about how to get floats to clear. I’m still not sure I understand it; I type clear: both and say a prayer to the box model.
        </p>

        <div class="orange-rec"></div>

        <h4 class="overlap"> { display: flex; } </h4>

        <p class="define">
        I was saved by Flexbox after five years of guess work. It is my baby. I was trained as a print designer, and with flexbox, I can type 3 or 4 lines of CSS, and have two blocks of text line up at the baseline. <em>Hallelujah.</em> I only needed to wait a decade to get this.
        </p>

        <div class="orange-rec"></div>

        <h4 class="overlap"> { display: grid; } </h4>

        <p class="p-space">
        And now, after flexing with flexbox, along comes CSS Grid: a powerful new feature that promises to make responsive web design even more confusing. Of course, I am joking about this, because Grid is a big improvement in controlling layout on the web.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I’m reminded of the table layouts I was doing in 1997. I know Grid and Table layouts are fundamentally different in their capabilities and approach, but that doesn’t stop me from being unreasonable and irrational about their surface similarities.
        </p>

        <p>
        We’ve completed a lap on a cycle which will go around forever. Another approach for layout will come along five years from now. It will probably resemble floats and not knowing how to clear a float will bite me in the ass for the second time in my career.
        </p>

        <p>
        Things are so often only understood by those who are well-positioned in the middle of the current wave of thought. If you’re before the sweet spot in the wave, your inexperience means you know nothing. 
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-p">
        One argument says that continual change in methodology is rigorous and healthy. I agree. Keeping things in play helps us to more easily fix what’s wrong. But I also agree with the other argument:
        </p>

        <h3> People only have so much patien-ce.<br>
            <div id="empty-box2"></div>
            <span class="emoticon"> { ● ̀ _  ́● } </span>
        </h3>

        <p class="top-p"> 
        Methods that were once taboo are back on the table. For instance, last week I was reading a post about the benefits of not using stylesheets and instead having inline styles for everything.
        </p>

        <p>
        So much of how we build websites and software comes down to how we think. The churn of tools, methods, and abstractions also signify the replacement of ideology.
        </p>

        <p>
        Experience, on the other hand, creates two distinct struggles: the first is to identify and unlearn what is no longer necessary <em>(that’s work, too).</em> The second is to remain open-minded and willing to engage with what is new, even if it seems to resemble a new take on something you decided against a long time ago.
        </p>

        <p>
        We don’t necessarily go looking for better tools or fancier processes. In the past, I’ve called this following the <em>grain of the web,</em> which is to use design choices that swing with what HTML, CSS, and screens make easy, flexible, and resilient.
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-p">
        To test how much complexity comes along with my limited needs, I wrote down the technical requirements of my web design practice. It’s not a long list:
        </p>

        <div class="orange-rec"></div>

        <h4 class="overlap">
            simple, responsive layout

            web fonts
            & nicely set text

            performant, scalable images
        </h4>

        <p class="p-space">
        All of these have been more than met for at least five years, but the complexity of even these very fundamental needs has ballooned in the last few years.
        </p>

        <p>
        For instance, I showed you 4 different ways to put two things next to each other. Each new method mostly replaces the last, so hopefully we’re reaching a stabilization point with flexbox and CSS Grid. But who knows what will come out five years from now?
        </p>

        <p>
        Webfonts? I thought we could jot down a few lines with @font-face, but <em>A Book Apart</em> just published a 90 page e-book on how to load those fonts. This is totally surprising to me: I thought implementing webfonts was a relatively easy procedure, but I guess not!
        </p>

        <p>
        My point is that the foundations are now sufficiently complicated enough on their own that it seems foolish to go add more optional complexity on top of it. 
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-p">
        I’ve kept my examples to the most basic of web implementations, and I haven’t even touched on Javascript, libraries, animation, frameworks, pre-processors, package managers, testing, automation, or deployment. <em>Whew.</em>
        </p>

        <div class="orange-rec"></div>

        <h4 class="overlap"> simply npm your webpack via grunt with vue babel or bower to react asdfjkl;lkdhgxdlc </h4>

        <p class="p-space">
        If you go talk to a senior software developer, you’ll probably hear them complain about spaghetti code. This is when code is opaque overwrought, unorganized, and snarled with dependencies.
        </p>

        <p>
        I perked up when I heard the term used for the first time, because, while I can’t identify spaghetti code as a designer, I sure as hell know about spaghetti workflows and spaghetti toolchains.
        </p>

        <p>
        The best way to help someone write markup is to make sure they can read markup.
        </p>

        <p>
        I wonder what young designers think of this situation, how they’re educating themselves in a complicated field. How do they learn if the code is illegible? Does it seem like more experienced people are pulling up the ladder of opportunity?
        </p>

        Silicon Valley has tried to provide a few of these. All are about speed. The most famous comes from Facebook, with their <em>“Move fast and break things”</em> mantra. This phrase has been thrown under the bus enough times by now, but it is interesting that so few are willing to commit to its opposite:
        </p>

        <h3> Go slow<br> <span class="and-symbol">&</span> fix things.<br>
            <div id="empty-box2"></div>
            <span class="emoticon"> { ⌐■_■ } </span>
        </h3>

        This has been my favorite internet discovery of the last few months. See, the rabbit doesn’t lose because he gets tired. He loses because he gets confused about which direction to go. Did you notice how it stops in the middle and stares blankly as everyone around it yells about things it doesn’t understand? That’s me on Twitter.
        </p>

        <p>
        The web also needs diligent people so that the idea of what the web is and what it does remains legible to everyone. The call for legibility should also humbly apply to writing legible code and designs systems that are easy for nearly anyone to interpret thanks to their elegance.
        </p>

        <p>
        It’s by keeping our work legible that we keep the door open to the next generation of our co-workers.

        What works for them also works for us, because whether you are just out of school or have twenty years of experience, you’ll eventually end up in the same spot: <em>your first year of making websites.</em>
